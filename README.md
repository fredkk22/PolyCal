# PolyCal

## Description
This is a basic Python application that employs the math and unittest modules along with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to create methods and object instances for rectangles and shapes. The various methods allow the user to create, view, and calculate the various properties of either a square or a rectangle. The code was initially created on replit, but transferred over to Github for easier access and workflow for potential future development/collaboration.

## Usage
In `main.py`, initialize your object instance using the `Rectangle` class created in `shape_calculator.py`! <br>
<br>
<em>NOTE:<em> The Square class is a <em>subclass<em> of the Rectangle class. <br>
<br>
Using the methods created in `shape_calculator.py`, you can view the shape; change the height or width; calculate the area, perimeter, or diagonal; and find out how many squares fit in each rectangle in `main.py`. Then, run the following command in the terminal to view your resulting budget: `python3 main.py`. <br>
<br>
If you would like to run the unit tests, please run `python3 test_module.py` in the terminal.
